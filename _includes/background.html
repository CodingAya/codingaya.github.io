      I'm currently a third-year Computer Science and Microelectronics Engineering student at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.mines-stetienne.fr/" target="_blank">Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne</a>. 
      Iâ€™m expected to graduate by Fall 2024 with a double degree since I already completed two years of undergraduate 
      engineering studies at Ecole Hassania des Travaux Publics</a>.

    <p>
      I'm driven by my strong appetite for <strong>Data Science</strong>, <strong>Data Engineering</strong>, and <strong>Data Analysis</strong>. And I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; I love to illustrate complex concepts into simple
      and beautiful illustrations.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of my computer screen</strong>, I'm working on extracurricular activities,
      learning new korean words or working out.
